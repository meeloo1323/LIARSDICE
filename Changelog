 - Added limitations to calls. Now you have to bid higher.
 - Added a loop to continue to prompt for a call until a valid input is given.
 - Added a rough probability calculator that takes in how many dice of a certain value it has
 and see how likely it is for a player to have as many dice of that value as there are missing from the call
